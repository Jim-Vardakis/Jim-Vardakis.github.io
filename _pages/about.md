So... My name is *Dimitris Vardakis*. I finished my undergraduate studies at the University of Crete in Greece, and then completed my PhD at Michigan State University under [Alexander Volberg](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexander-Volberg). Currently, I am doing my postdoc at Julius-Maximilians-Universit채t (JMU) in W체rzburg, Germany, under [Stefanie Petermichl](https://www.mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/harmonicanalysis/team/petermichl-stefanie/).

My Research
======
revolves around Harmonic Analysis (also on the Hamming cube), Geometric Measure Theory, and Dynamical Systems. I am interested in the decay rate of the Favard length of (random) Cantor sets and on certain (somehow relevant) one-phase problems. Currently, I'm working on the boundedness of Calder처n-Zygmund operators with matrix weights. At the same time, I am trying to construct Julia sets through random iterations.

The obligatory "research interests" list:
------
- Julia sets
- Random Cantor sets
- Favard length
- Calder처n-Zygmund operators
- Matrix weights
- Boolean functions
